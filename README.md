## Risk Assessment & Mitigation Strategies

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|------------|--------|---------------------|
| Resistance to standardization | High | High | Involve team representatives early; focus on benefits and flexibility; allow for team-specific adaptations within frameworks |
| Lack of stakeholder engagement | Medium | High | Secure executive sponsorship; regular updates; highlight early wins |
| Scope creep | High | Medium | Clear charter document; rigorous change control process; focus on minimum viable standards |
| Resource constraints | Medium | Medium | Pre-scheduled participation; focus on async collaboration where possible |
| Incompatible existing processes | Medium | High | Phased implementation approach; allow for reasonable transition periods |
| Adoption challenges post-project | High | High | Create implementation playbooks; assign "champions" in each team; follow-up review sessions |
| Technical integration issues | Medium | Medium | Early involvement of DevOps and tooling teams; proof-of-concept validation |

## Communication Plan

### Regular Communications
- **Daily:** 15-minute CPTT core team stand-ups
- **Bi-weekly:** All-stakeholder update meetings
- **Weekly:** Detailed progress report to engineering leadership
- **Ad-hoc:** Issue-specific discussions as needed

### Communication Channels
- **Documentation:** Centralized Confluence space with all project artifacts
- **Project Updates:** Email digest to all stakeholders
- **Discussion Forum:** Dedicated Slack channel for ongoing conversations
- **Decision Log:** Maintained and distributed after each key decision point

### Feedback Mechanisms
- Anonymous suggestion box for team members
- Structured feedback sessions after each workshop
- Regular pulse checks with team representatives

## Success Metrics

### Process Metrics
- % of teams with formally adopted standards in each focus area
- Time to reach consensus on each standard
- Stakeholder participation and engagement rates
- Documentation completeness and clarity (via feedback surveys)

### Outcome Metrics
